%% BLIND SOURCE EXTRACTION BASED ON KOLMOGOROV-CHAITIN COMPLEXITY
%
%   Examples of blind source extraction (BSE) based on Kolmogorov-Chaitin
%   complexity, which is estimated by means of lossless compression of data (in
%   this case, we use the LZW compression of TIFF images). To perform the BSE,
%   we assume that the mixtures are more complex (i.e., can be less compressed)
%   than the source image.
%
%   The scenario is as follows:
%       * A is the full rank mixing matrix, which is given by:
%
%           A = [cos(\theta)  -sin(\theta)
%                sin(\theta)   cos(\theta)]
%
%       * w is the extraction vector, which is:
%
%           w = [cos(\phi)  sin(\phi)]^T.
%
%   Before applying the mixing process, the images are converted to 1-D arrays.
%   Thus, we have:
%
%           x = A*s,
%
%   where x corresponds to the mixed images and s are the souces (one is the
%   image of interest and the other is a noisy image).
%   The extraction process is given by:
%
%           y = w*x
%
%   where y is the recovered image.
